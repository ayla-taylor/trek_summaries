"Investigating a damaged satellite near a binary star system on the edge of Federation space, the crew members of the USS Shenzhou discover an object obscured from their sensors. After First Officer Michael Burnham volunteers to investigate the object, she finds an ancient, carved vessel. She is attacked by a Klingon, and when trying to escape, she accidentally kills him. A group of Klingons mourn the death of their soldier, dubbed the ""Torchbearer"", before the outcast Voq volunteers to take his place. The Klingons, led by T'Kuvma, reveal themselves in a cloakable ship. T'Kuvma preaches to his followers of the Federation's attempts to usurp the individuality of the Klingons and their culture, and plans to fulfill an ancient prophecy by uniting the 24 great Klingon houses as was once done by Kahless. Voq activates a beacon that summons the Klingon leaders. Burnham, desperate to prevent a war, attempts to fire on the Klingons first, against the wishes of Captain Philippa Georgiou. Burnham is arrested for mutiny."
"T'Kuvma convinces the majority of the Klingon leaders that he can lead them to victory over the Federation, as reinforcements for the Shenzhou arrive. Georgiou offers to resolve the situation peacefully, but the Klingons immediately open fire. Starfleet Admiral Anderson arrives and again offers peace to the Klingons, but his ship is rammed by another cloaked Klingon vessel. Anderson has his ship self-destruct, destroying the Klingon ship as well. Starfleet retreats, leaving the Klingons to collect their dead. In the remains of the Shenzhou, Burnham escapes her cell after encouragement from her guardian Sarek via a telepathic connection. She convinces Georgiou to try to take T'Kuvma prisoner, and they create a distraction by sending an explosive into his ship with a Klingon corpse. Boarding the vessel, Burnham overpowers Voq. Georgiou attempts to capture T'Kuvma, but is killed. T'Kuvma is fatally shot by Burnham, who is transported to safety. Voq promises that T'Kuvma's legacy will live on. Burnham is later sentenced to life in prison for her mutiny."
"Six months into her sentence, Burnham is on an unexpected prison transfer when an emergency forces her shuttle to be rescued by the USS Discovery. Spending several days on the ship, Burnham is ordered by its captain, the mysterious Gabriel Lorca, to assist with a scientific assignment. Burnham overhears Lieutenant Paul Stamets, an astromycologist who is leading the assignment, discuss an upcoming experiment with a colleague serving on another starship; Lorca is soon informed of an incident on the Discovery's sister ship, the USS Glenn, that has killed the entire crew. Stamets leads a boarding party to investigate and finds the dead crew hideously twisted and malformed, as well as a group of Klingons killed by an unknown creature. Lorca later asks Burnham to work for him, despite her sentence, explaining that he organized the circumstances that led her to him so she could help develop a new spore-based propulsion system that could win the war she started by killing T'Kuvma. He also secretly has the creature transported aboard the Discovery."
"Lorca assigns Burnham to study the creature from the Glenn, dubbed a Tardigrade, to find a way to use its biology as a weapon. Starfleet orders Discovery to the dilithium mining colony Corvan II, which is under Klingon attack. Stamets is reluctant to make such a long jump using the spores, and when the drive is activated the ship nearly collides with a star. Lorca sends Commander Landry to keep Burnham's research on track, and she attempts to sedate the Tardigrade (that she names Ripper) to cut off its claw; it kills her. Burnham believes that Ripper was acting in self-defense, and is drawn to the spores. Stamets and Burnham transport it to Engineering, where it connects to the spore drive and interfaces with the navigation system. The ship successfully makes the jump to Corvan II and saves the colony. On T'Kuvma's stranded ship, Klingon leader Kol earns the loyalty of T'Kuvma's desperate followers, and leaves Voq to die in the wreckage of the Shenzhou. L'Rell, secretly loyal to Voq, promises a way for them to win the war for the house of T'Kuvma."
"After a month of successful operations, Lorca is ordered to protect the spore drive until it can be replicated for other Starfleet ships. As he returns to the Discovery, Lorca is taken captive by the Klingons. Burnham has grown concerned by the toll that the drive has taken on Ripper. Along with Stamets' partner, medical officer Hugh Culber, Burnham convinces Stamets to find an alternative to run the drive. Lorca is imprisoned with captured Starfleet officer Ash Tyler and human criminal Harry Mudd, and in discussions Lorca reveals that he killed his entire crew during an earlier battle to spare them from the Klingons' torture, but escaped himself. Lorca is tortured by L'Rell, who wants the secret behind Discovery's new form of travel, but Lorca and Tyler escape before the Klingons learn anything. For the final jump needed to escape the Klingons, with Lorca and Tyler on-board, Stamets connects to the spore drive himself using Ripper's DNA. Later, Burnham frees Ripper, while Stamets' reflection does not walk away from a mirror when he does."
"On his way to broker a peace deal with renegade Klingon houses, Sarek is injured when a ""logic extremist"" attempts to assassinate him. Burnham senses this, and Lorca agrees to rescue Sarek. Admiral Katrina Cornwell questions this decision and others that Lorca has been making. Burnham searches for Sarek in a shuttle with her roommate, Cadet Sylvia Tilly, and Tyler. Burnham attempts to connect with Sarek's mind, and finds him remembering the time that her application for the Vulcan Expeditionary Group was rejected. She learns that the VEG would only admit one of Sarek's children, and he chose Spock, his half-human son. Spock ultimately chose to join Starfleet, rendering Sarek's decision futile. Burnham helps him regain consciousness and activate a locator beacon. Lorca and Cornwell have sex, but she is concerned by his paranoid behavior and plans to remove him from command of Discovery. With Sarek unable to meet the Klingons, Cornwell takes his place; however, the peace talks are actually a trap, and she is taken captive."
"While attending a crew party, Burnham and Tyler are called to the bridge to deal with an endangered space creature, a gormagander, that the Discovery has come across. When the creature is brought on board, it is revealed to be carrying a person: Harry Mudd. He plans to kill Lorca and sell the ship to the Klingons, but when he is caught he blows up the ship instead. Time returns to the party earlier, with Burnham and Tyler called to the bridge again. They are intercepted by Stamets, who is aware that they are in a time loop due to his interactions with Ripper. Over numerous time loops Stamets works with Burnham and Tyler to find a solution to the problem while Mudd gets further in his plan each time. They eventually convince Mudd that he has won, and he ends the time loop. Preparing to receive a boarding party of Klingons, Mudd is instead confronted by his ""beloved"" Stella and her father, from whom he had stolen her dowry. They take Mudd away. Stamets reveals to Burnham and Tyler that in one of the time loops they had danced together and kissed."
"Coming to the aid of another Federation ship, the Discovery is unable to prevent the ship's destruction by a Klingon ship with cloaking technology. Desperate for a way to detect these ships even when they are cloaked, Burnham, Tyler, and Saru are sent to Pahvo, a seemingly uninhabited planet with a naturally occurring crystalline transmitter that broadcasts the planet's vibrational frequency into space. They hope to use the transmitter to create a sonar for the hidden Klingon ships. They discover that Pahvo is inhabited with indigenous life that introduce Saru to their higher understanding of peace, and he attempts to force Burnham and Tyler to remain with him on the planet forever. Burnham is able to fight off Saru and broadcast the new signal. However, the Pahvo lifeforms adjust the signal to contact the Klingons as well, hoping to end the war. Kol receives the signal, after sentencing L'Rell to death: she had tried to help Cornwell escape in exchange for protection from Kol, leading to L'Rell apparently killing Cornwell to try to save face with Kol."
"Lorca is ordered to flee before the Klingons arrive, but disobeys to protect the lifeforms on Pahvo and improve their chances of detecting the cloaked ships. When the Klingons arrive, Tyler and Burnham transport to their ship and plant sensors that will help create an algorithm for detecting the cloaked ships. They find an alive Cornwell hidden with L'Rell, but encountering the latter sends Tyler into shock due to the torture and rape she subjected him to. Lorca has Stamets make 133 micro-jumps in order to provide a three-dimensional reading of the sensors, while Burnham distracts Kol by challenging him to a fight. The jumps are completed, though not without trauma to Stamets. When the algorithm is calculated, Burnham, Tyler, Cornwell, and L'Rell (who wishes to defect) are transported back to the Discovery and the Klingon ship is destroyed. Stamets volunteers to make one more jump to safety, but tells Lorca it will be his last. However, Lorca changes the coordinates and they jump to an unknown destination surrounded by debris from Klingon ships."
"Discovery's crew determines that they have arrived in a parallel Mirror Universe, with Stamets now unconscious and unable to power the spore drive. Tyler confronts L'Rell, and she attempts to use a verbal cue to trigger something within him, though he fights this off. From a data core from a wrecked Klingon ship, they learn that this universe is ruled by the human Terran Empire, who are fighting a resistance that includes species such as Klingons and Vulcans. Here, Burnham is the former captain of the ISS Shenzhou, presumed dead after an attack by the fugitive Lorca. The ISS Discovery is captained by Sylvia Tilly's counterpart, so she and the crew pretend to be their Mirror selves. They deliver Burnham and Lorca to the Shenzhou, under the ruse that Burnham had been hunting Lorca since her presumed death and had now captured him. Tyler accompanies them, after first killing Culber when he informs Tyler that he appears to have undergone major surgical modifications. On the Shenzhou, Lorca is tortured while Burnham assumes command."
"The ISS Shenzhou is given the coordinates of the resistance leadership, and ordered to kill them all. Burnham and Tyler travel as a landing party themselves and instead surrender to the resistance in hopes of learning how the Klingons of this universe have learned to work with other species; they find that the Mirror Voq is the leader. Burnham offers to give the group time to escape before their base is destroyed, and Mirror Sarek confirms she can be trusted after connecting to her mind. Listening to Voq triggers Tyler's programming, and he has to be restrained. Back on the ship, he reveals to Burnham that he now knows he was once Voq, and that he underwent surgery to appear human and infiltrate Starfleet. She has him beamed into space, where he is picked up by the USS Discovery. Saru and Tilly imprison him, having earlier found the body of Culber, and apparently failed to heal Stamets using spores. Burnham is reprimanded for not killing the resistance leaders immediately by the Emperor—the Mirror Georgiou."
"Burnham and Lorca are summoned to the ISS Charon, the imperial flagship. Georgiou sends Lorca to a torturous agony booth, and has dinner with Burnham. Stamets finds himself within the mycelial network with the consciousness of his Mirror counterpart, learning that the network has been corrupted by the Mirror Stamets' experiments. Stamets encounters a representation of Culber and accepts his loss, before waking up to find his spore collection infected. Georgiou laments allowing Lorca to become a father figure for Burnham, only for the pair to fall in love and plot to overthrow her. She plans to execute Burnham, who reveals the truth about being from another universe. Explaining how they had crossed over, Georgiou trades the spore drive's schematics for information on alternative ways to cross between universes, which leads Burnham to realize that the Lorca she knows is actually from the Mirror Universe, and has been manipulating events to get close to her and back to the Mirror Universe. Lorca escapes from the agony booth."
"Lorca frees his old crew, who have been tortured since his disappearance, and with the help of Mirror Stamets they are able to kill those loyal to Georgiou and usurp her throne. She goes into hiding, while Burnham also evades capture and contacts the Discovery. They agree to a plan in which Burnham lowers the containment field around a large energy source originating from the mycelial network. The Discovery will then arrive to destroy the energy source, causing an explosion which they can ride into the mycelial network through which Stamets could navigate them home. Georgiou agrees to help Burnham, and they attack Lorca's group. Rejected and defeated by Burnham, Lorca is killed by Georgiou, who offers to sacrifice herself to allow Burnham's escape. The latter instead takes Georgiou with her as they are beamed to the Discovery, and the Charon is destroyed. Back in their own universe, the Discovery crew learns that they have arrived nine months after they left, and in the meantime, the Klingons have nearly won the war."
"The Discovery is boarded by Cornwell and Sarek, who explain that the Klingon houses remain divided, and fight between themselves to see which can destroy more Federation assets. The only safe refuge for Starfleet beyond Earth is now Starbase 1, and they warp there with Cornwell assuming command. After emergency surgery performed by L'Rell, Tyler now has his personality back, but can still access Voq's memories; Burnham is unable to forgive his actions as Voq. The crew finds Starbase 1 conquered by a Klingon house, and the remainder of Starfleet's command withdraws to protect Earth. Georgiou tells Burnham that she defeated the Klingons in the Mirror Universe with a surprise attack on their homeworld of Qo'noS, and Cornwell agrees to replicate that now. To jump into Klingon territory, Stamets terraforms a desolate moon to grow a new crop of spores so they can use the spore drive. Georgiou tells Sarek and Cornwell of other essential information she has, and they have her pose as Captain Georgiou to lead the mission."
"Tyler suggests that a drone enter Qo'noS's underground, dormant volcanic system to covertly search the planet for targets. Discovery jumps to a cave near the system's entrance, and a party of Georgiou, Burnham, Tilly, and Tyler pose as traders. Tilly discovers that the volcanic system is active, and that the ""drone"" Georgiou has is a hydro-bomb. Burnham confronts Cornwell, who admits that detonating the bomb in the active volcano will annihilate all life on Qo'noS, winning the war. Burnham insists that Starfleet not commit genocide, and convinces Georgiou to give up the detonator in exchange for her freedom. They give the detonator to L'Rell, who uses the threat of mass destruction to unite the Klingon houses under her leadership and end the war. The Discovery crew are hailed as heroes, and Burnham is issued a full pardon and restored to the rank of commander. Tyler chooses to remain with L'Rell. As Discovery warps to Vulcan to pick up its new captain, it receives a distress call from Captain Pike of the USS Enterprise."
"En route to the planet Vulcan to pick up its new captain after Gabriel Lorca betrayed the crew during the Federation–Klingon War, the USS Discovery receives a distress call from the USS Enterprise. Captain Christopher Pike takes emergency command of Discovery, explaining that the Enterprise suffered catastrophic damage while investigating seven mysterious signals scattered across the galaxy. Six of the signals have since disappeared, as does the seventh when Discovery arrives at its location. The crew discovers the wreckage of the USS Hiawatha, which had been believed lost during the war, on an asteroid composed of non-baryonic matter. Inside they find chief engineer Jett Reno nursing the last survivors. Commander Michael Burnham, having seen a ""red angel"" while on the asteroid, visits the Enterprise to search the quarters of her foster brother Spock, who Pike reveals is on a leave of absence from Starfleet. She discovers a file from his personal log, describing nightmares of the seven signals he has had since childhood."
"Burnham confronts Pike with Spock's personal log entry. He reveals that Spock committed himself to a psychiatric unit one week after taking leave and requested that Starfleet not inform her or his parents. Discovery detects another of the signals and uses the spore drive to travel to a Beta Quadrant planet with a previously unknown human population. A looped transmission suggests that the population departed Earth sometime during World War III. Pike and Burnham lead an away team to the surface, finding a primitive society with a religion combining multiple human faiths. As the investigation continues, an anomaly produces an extinction-level radiation shower. Ensign Silvia Tilly, acting on a fellow ensign's advice, uses a sample from the asteroid to avert catastrophe. Tilly later recognizes the ensign as May Ahearn, a high school classmate who died five years earlier. Returning to Discovery, Pike reviews footage from a soldier's helmet camera from the society and learns the Red Angel from Burnham's vision brought the population from Earth."
"Spock's mother Amanda Grayson learns that he has escaped the psychiatric unit and is wanted for murdering three doctors. She steals his medical records and takes them to Discovery for decryption. Grayson recognizes a drawing in the records from Spock's childhood art: the Red Angel. Burnham admits to emotionally hurting Spock when they were young to protect him from Vulcan's logic extremists. On Qo'noS, Klingon house leader Kol-Sha threatens to kill Starfleet Officer Ash Tyler—formerly the Klingon Voq—and the Klingon Empire's leader L'Rell for having a secret child. Instead, they kill him with the help of Philippa Georgiou, the Empress of the Mirror Universe's Terran Empire, and now a Starfleet Section 31 agent. In a ruse to consolidate power, L'Rell convinces the Klingon High Council that Tyler and the baby are dead. Georgiou delivers the baby to a monastery and recruits Tyler to Section 31. Burnham and Engineer Paul Stamets use dark matter to remove a parasite from Tilly that caused her hallucination of May."
"A living, intelligent, planetoid-sized sphere pulls Discovery out of warp and immobilizes it. The crew surmises the Sphere is well-intentioned and has gathered gargantuan amounts of data from all over the galaxy that it does not want to be lost before it dies. However, the Sphere's hold on Discovery triggers the Vahar'ai in Commander Saru, a fatal condition to his species, the Kelpiens. The Sphere transmits its information to the crew and dies, releasing Discovery to not be caught in the ensuing explosion. Saru asks Burnham to help prepare for his death by removing his threat ganglia, which sense danger. However, they fall out on their own and leave Saru healthy and living without overwhelming fear. Meanwhile, the parasite attaches itself to Tilly again, once again accessing her memories to communicate as a hallucination of May. The parasite claims Discovery has nearly destroyed its ecosystem by using its species' mycelial network to jump through space with the spore drive. It then consumes Tilly, leaving no trace of her."
"Stamets and Burnham conclude that Tilly has been taken into the mycelial network. She wakes up there with the May parasite, who wants her to help stop a ""monster"" ravaging their world. Discovery finds the shuttle that Spock used to escape the psychiatric unit to find Georgiou on board. Section 31 Captain Leland assigns Tyler to Discovery as a liaison to ensure that Discovery does not interfere with Section 31's own investigation into Spock. Discovery conducts a half-jump into the mycelial network to give Stamets and Burnham limited time to find Tilly before the network consumes the ship. Burnham and Stamets discover the ""monster"" is Stamets' husband, Hugh Culber, the former Discovery Medical Officer who was murdered by Tyler during the war. Stamets was connected to the network when Culber died, allowing his energy to be recreated by the spores. Burnham now convinces May to use the parasite cocoon on Discovery, through which Tilly was transported into the network to rebuild Culber's body in normal space."
"Another of the mysterious signals leads Discovery to Saru's homeworld of Kaminar, where the Kelpiens' predators, the Ba'ul, demand Pike surrender Saru as Starfleet has agreed to stay out of the conflict between the two species. Pike refuses, but Saru turns himself over to prevent a fight. Tilly works with technologically-augmented Lieutenant Commander Airiam to sift through the Sphere's information on Kaminar: they learn that the post Vahar'ai Kelpiens were once Kaminar's dominant species and nearly eradicated the Ba'ul, with the latter only surviving by using their superior technology to cull Kelpiens before they lose their threat ganglia. Pike uses the Ba'ul's technology to trigger Vahar'ai in all Kelpiens, hoping the two species can instead work towards a peaceful solution once the Kelpiens are freed and learn the truth about their past from Saru's priestess sister Siranna. The Ba'ul retaliates to Starfleet's actions by attempting genocide but is stopped by the Red Angel, whom Saru sees as a humanoid wearing a highly-advanced suit."
"Discovery is confronted by a time anomaly while researching the Red Angel's signal over Kaminar. Pike and Tyler investigate the anomaly in a shuttlecraft, sending a probe into it. That same probe soon attacks them, now upgraded with future technology, which uses their shuttle's computer system to infect Airiam secretly. They destroy it with Stamets's help, as his exposure to the network allows him to ignore the time discrepancies in the anomaly. Meanwhile, Burnham visits Vulcan as she continues to search for Spock. Confronting Grayson, Burnham learns that she has been hiding Spock, who is in psychological distress, repeating phrases and a series of numbers. His father Sarek instructs Burnham to trust Starfleet and take Spock to Section 31 to fix his mind. Section 31's doctors claim that they can help him, but Georgiou warns her that Spock will not survive the memory extractor that Section 31 plans to use on him. Georgiou helps Burnham stage an attack that allows Burnham and Spock to escape the ship."
"Previously, the Enterprise visited Talos IV where Pike and Spock met the Talosians, beings that can create incredible illusions. Pike fell in love with Vina, an injured Federation crewman in the Talosians' care, but she was unable to leave the planet and survive, while Pike chose to return to the Enterprise. Starfleet banned future visits to Talos IV.[a] Now, Burnham and Spock secretly travel to Talos IV, where the Talosians heal Spock's mind in exchange for Burnham's memories of emotionally scarring Spock. The latter reveals that he mind-melded with the Red Angel, a time traveller trying to avert a galactic catastrophe in the future. Stamets attempts to reconnect with Culber, who is going through an identity crisis. Culber confronts Tyler but realizes that he is going through a similar crisis. Discovery collects Spock and Burnham after the Talosians help Vina contact Pike by telepathically projecting illusions of Spock and Burnham for Section 31 to capture as a distraction. Escaping, Discovery and its crew become fugitives from Starfleet."
"Starfleet Admiral Katrina Cornwell secretly boards Discovery to interrogate Spock and brings video footage depicting Spock murdering the three doctors. Saru discovers that Section 31 faked the footage using holograms, and Cornwell directs Discovery to Section 31 headquarters where Starfleet's Control artificial intelligence is kept. Control is behind the forgery and has been directing Section 31 to pursue Spock. Burnham, Security Officer Nahn, and Airiam beam into the headquarters to find the personnel, including Section 31's leadership, dead after Control turned off life-support systems. Airiam is tasked with restoring Control to Starfleet's intended purpose. Still, the virus from the future she carries is Control itself and instead attempts to upload the Sphere's knowledge of all artificial intelligence into Control's database. Airiam asks to be ejected into space before Control gains the knowledge it wishes; Burnham hesistates, however Commander Nhan jettisons Airiam before it is too late. Airiam dies reliving her favorite memory from before she was technologically-augmented."
"While preparing for Airiam's funeral, her system is purged of the Control virus along with all other Control systems around Starfleet. While doing this, Tilly discovers a bio-neural scan of the Red Angel in Airiam's code that matches Burnham. Leland reveals that Section 31 built the Red Angel time travel suit twenty years ago in a temporal-arms race with the Klingons and that Burnham's parents had been part of that program (with Leland's carelessness at the time leading to their deaths). They now plan to use Burnham as bait for the Red Angel. Discovery travels to Essof IV, where there is enough energy to power their trap. Burnham is left out in the planet's unbreathable atmosphere until the Red Angel appears. Leland's Section 31 ship can close the wormhole behind the Red Angel to stop future Control from following her through, though Leland is attacked by the present Control, which is still active within the ship. The Red Angel is caught in the trap and revives the momentarily dead Burnham, who recognizes the figure as her mother."
"When the Burnhams' laboratory was attacked by Klingons years ago, Michael's mother donned the time travel suit to go back in time an hour and warn them of the attack. She instead arrived 950 years in the future to find all sentient life destroyed by Control. Tethering herself to a nearby planet, Dr. Burnham made over 840 attempts to change the future, including moving humans to her planet, Terralysium, to test how she can change history. Trying to stop Control from gaining the Sphere's data, Dr. Burnham was responsible for crossing paths with the Discovery. Now, the Discovery crew plans to upload the data into the suit and send it to the future where Control cannot access it while keeping Dr. Burnham in the present, but a Control-possessed Leland intercepts their download. Georgiou and Tyler confront Leland, with Tyler gravely injured but able to warn Discovery. The crew is forced to cut the transmission short and release Dr. Burnham back to the future, with the suit now damaged. Control-Leland escapes with half of the sphere data."
"A new signal appears over Boreth, a place sacred to Klingons, where a Klingon monastery is located and where monks guard time crystals. Tyler and L'Rell left their son to be raised by these monks. Pike visits the monastery to retrieve a time crystal and finds the son is now a fully grown adult named Tenavik. Tenavik explains that life on Boreth is affected by the crystals and that if Pike takes one, he will not be able to change the future that it shows him. Pike sees a future where he is severely disabled in an accident but chooses to take the crystal to serve the greater good. Meanwhile, Burnham and Spock investigate a Section 31 ship that had checked in ten minutes later than usual and find all of the crew dead except for one, Kamran Gant, an old colleague of Burnham who has been possessed by Control and attempts to take over Burnham. Spock can stop Control with magnetism, and they escape back to Discovery. The Section 31 fleet soon arrives, forcing Pike to order Discovery be destroyed to keep the sphere data away from Control."
"Part 1 : Discovery escapes and rendezvous with the Enterprise, with Discovery evacuated onto the other starship. From there, they initiate the self-destruct, but the sphere data takes control of Discovery's systems and prevents this from happening. It also defends itself from torpedoes. Burnham proposes that the time crystal be used to take Discovery itself to the future where Control cannot get to it, planning to wear a copy of her mother's suit to lead the ship there. Pike agrees and resumes command of the Enterprise to keep Control distracted. A new signal appears, leading Discovery and Enterprise to the planet Xahea which is ruled by Tilly's friend Queen Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po. A brilliant engineer, Po helps Stamets, Tilly, and Reno prepare the suit and time crystal for the journey. Some of the Discovery's crew choose to stay with Burnham, as does Georgiou, while Pike makes Saru acting captain. As the Section 31 fleet arrives, Discovery and Enterprise prepare for battle while the suit and time crystal are finalized. Part 2 : Tyler retrieves the Klingon fleet to assist in the battle, while Siranna arrives with Ba'ul fighters after receiving a farewell message from Saru. Stamets is seriously injured and is cared for by Culber. A Section 31 torpedo penetrates the Enterprise without detonating, but a secondary detonation kills Cornwell after sealing off the surrounding area. Control-Leland boards Discovery and is defeated when Georgiou magnetizes the nanites in his body, allowing Section 31's fleet to be destroyed. In the suit, Burnham travels to the past and sets the five signals that led them to this point. She then sets a sixth for Discovery to follow as she travels forward over 900 years and promises to set a seventh when they arrive. The Enterprise tell Starfleet that Discovery was destroyed in the battle and are ordered to never speak of it or the crew again (on Spock's recommendation, to prevent another incident like Control). Tyler is placed in command of Section 31. Months later, the Enterprise detects the seventh signal as it begins a new adventure."
"After traveling to the future to protect sensitive information from Control, an artificial intelligence destined to destroy all life, Michael Burnham arrives in the year 3188 and learns that she was successful—life exists in this future. Burnham crashes into the ship of Cleveland ""Book"" Booker, a courier transporting stolen cargo. He explains that in an event called ""The Burn"", most of the galaxy's dilithium exploded, destroying many starships including most of Starfleet. Now the galaxy is disconnected and is no longer governed by the United Federation of Planets. Burnham helps Book protect his cargo, an endangered trance worm that he is taking to a sanctuary, from other couriers. In exchange, Book takes her to a seemingly abandoned Federation space station where they find Aditya Sahil, a ""Federation liaison"" waiting in the hope that a Starfleet officer would come to the station one day. Burnham gives him a commission to serve as acting communications chief. He is unable to locate the USS Discovery, which was traveling to the future with Burnham."
"The USS Discovery crash-lands on a glacier. The ship is damaged and crewmembers are wounded, including helm officer Keyla Detmer. Acting captain Saru decides to repair the ship before exploring the outside world, but they learn that they are missing resources that they require to complete the repairs. Saru and ensign Silvia Tilly go to a nearby settlement to get the resources they need and find a group of poor miners being oppressed by a courier named Zareh. The miners use programmable matter to help Discovery in exchange for some of the ship's dilithium, which would allow them to leave the planet and escape Zareh. However, Zareh arrives and attacks the group, killing one of the miners and planning to take all of Discovery's dilithium. He is stopped when Phillipa Georgiou arrives, against Saru's orders, and overpowers Zareh and his men. The crew return to Discovery with the resources they need, but the glacier's parasitic ice has encased the ship and it is unable to take off until Burnham arrives and frees them with Book's ship."
"With Sahil not able to locate the Discovery in 3188, Burnham becomes a courier and works with Book, searching for clues as to the fate of the Federation. She finds a transmission from Admiral Senna Tal on Earth, but is unable to get there with their limited dilithium. After a year, Discovery arrives in the future and Burnham finds them. Saru becomes the new captain, and Discovery's dilithium is stored on Book's cloaked ship, which he parks in their docking bay, for safety. Using Discovery's advanced spore drive, they travel to Earth and find it no longer part of the Federation. Investigators from the United Earth Defense Force board Discovery and explain that Tal is dead. They are all attacked by dilithium bandits who the EDF attempt to destroy until Burnham and Book trick the bandits, capturing their leader Wen. In negotiations between Wen and EDF Captain Ndoye, the two sides realize that they can help each other and prevent further fighting. A young human investigator named Adira is identified as the host of Tal's Trill symbiont and is connected to his memories."
"As a human host to a Trill symbiont, Adira cannot remember becoming the host of the Tal symbiont, and cannot access the memories of previous hosts such as Senna. Burnham takes them to the Trill homeworld in hopes that the Trill can help unlock their memories. The Trill are also no longer part of the Federation, but welcome Discovery due to their need for new symbiont hosts. However, many Trill refuse to believe that a non-Trill could host a symbiont, and Adira is turned away. A group of Trill attempt to kill Adira and take the symbiont, but Burnham stops them and a friendly Trill, Guardian Xi, offers to help. At the sacred Caves of Mak'ala, Xi and Burnham help Adira connect to Tal's memories: when Senna died, Tal was transferred to Gray, Adira's Trill boyfriend. However, Gray was killed shortly thereafter and Adira offered to become the new host to save Tal and the memories of all previous hosts. After gaining access to Tal's memories, Adira is able to communicate with Gray. Meanwhile, Saru attempts to improve crew morale with the help of Dr. Hugh Culber."
"Using Senna's memories, Adira guides Discovery to Starfleet headquarters. Starfleet Commander-in-Chief Charles Vance asks for Burnham, Saru, and Adira to beam over to the base, where Adira is taken away for medical testing. Vance informs Saru and Burnham that the crew will be interrogated and re-assigned while their ship is studied, which Saru agrees to in hopes of earning the trust of Starfleet. Realizing that Starfleet is dealing with a health crisis that could be solved through the seed archives aboard the USS Tikhov, Burnham receives approval from Vance to take the Discovery crew there with the spore drive and retrieve the seeds. They find the occupants of the Tikhov dead except for a man who is fatally injured. He is the same species as security officer Nhan, who decides to remain with the Tikhov to ensure he and his family receive a proper burial. Discovery returns to Starfleet with the seeds, and an antidote for the health crisis is synthesized. Vance agrees that the Discovery crew may remain together, but they must answer to him."
"The Discovery is upgraded to utilize 32nd century technology, including programmable matter. Vance sends other Starfleet ships on various missions across the remaining Federation space, but orders Discovery to remain at the ready for any rapid-response missions. Book's ship arrives carrying a three-week-old message from him about a new discovery he has made, the black box for a Starfleet ship that was destroyed in the Burn. Burnham believes that she can use this black box to trace the origin of the Burn, but Saru orders her to remain on the Discovery in case Vance needs them. Burnham agrees but then disobeys this order by taking Georgiou in Book's ship to go find him. On the salvage planet Hunhau, Georgiou poses as a buyer looking for rare ship pieces while Burnham looks for Book. They stage a prison break for the servants working at the salvage yards, allowing their escape with Book and the black box. When they return, Burnham is reprimanded by Vance for disobeying orders. Saru demotes Burnham from her position as his first officer."
"After studying several black boxes, Burnham believes she can find the source of the Burn with data from Project SB-19, a possible space travel alternative to dilithium developed by the unified Vulcan and Romulan people on Ni'Var (formerly the planet Vulcan). They believe SB-19 caused the Burn and do not want to give the data to the Federation, whom they have left. Vance believes Burnham can convince the Ni-Varians otherwise since her brother, Spock, had begun the process of unifying the Vulcans and Romulans. At Ni'Var, Burnham invokes T'Kal-in-ket, a Vulcan trial intended to verify her scientific claim to the SB-19 data. She is represented by her mother Gabrielle, who was previously trapped in the future and has since joined the Qowat Milat, a sect of Romulan warrior nuns. Gabrielle makes Burnham confront her own intentions and sense of confusion about her destiny, leading to Burnham withdrawing from the trial. Impressed by this, Ni'Var President T'Rina gives Burnham the SB-19 data. Meanwhile, Saru names Tilly as his acting first officer."
"Book receives a distress signal from his brother Kyheem, who says their home planet Kwejian is being threatened by the Emerald Chain, a syndicate of Andorians and Orions led by Osyraa. Kwejian's harvests have been devastated by locusts following climate changes caused by the Burn, and Kyheem made a deal with Osyraa to repel the locusts in exchange for Kwejian's trance worms. This caused a rift between Book and Kyheem. Civilizations that receive help from the Emerald Chain often collapse, so Discovery travels to Kwejian. Kyheem reveals to Book and Burnham that Osyraa wants Ryn, an Andorian servant that was freed on Hunhau. After a fight, Kyheem agrees to disobey Osyraa in exchange for Discovery helping to repel the locusts. During this time, Discovery keeps Osyraa from taking Ryn by attacking her with Book's ship, but she sees through the ruse and promises retaliation against the Federation before retreating. Meanwhile, Culber studies Georgiou who appears to be ill and is experiencing blackouts and flashbacks."
"Part 1 : Culber is visited by Kovich, a mysterious Starfleet operative, who explains that since Georgiou has both traveled through time and from a different universe, the Mirror Universe, her molecules have moved too far from their origin and she is now likely to die. Consulting with Discovery's computer, which has been augmented with the intelligent Sphere data, Culber believes that Georgiou could be saved by traveling to an uninhabited planet, Dannus V. Stamets and Adira use the SB-19 data to trace the source of the Burn to the Verubin Nebula, and discover a distress signal from a Kelpien starship. On Dannus V, Georgiou and Burnham encounter a strange being named Carl who directs Georgiou to a door. On the other side, she finds herself back in the Mirror Universe during the time she was Emperor of the Terran Empire. Georgiou finds that her time with Discovery has changed her, and she uses her knowledge of the past to alter certain events, including rescuing the slave Saru and sparing the life of the treacherous Michael Burnham. Part 2 : Georgiou hopes to lead an improved Terran Empire with Burnham by her side, and has the latter tortured until she pledges her allegiance. Georgiou reveals to Saru that the Kelpien biological change known as Vahar'ai does not mean it is time for him to be culled; rather, it is a natural process that will make him stronger if he allows it to happen. Burnham and Georgiou work together to hunt Burnham's former lover Gabriel Lorca, but this is a ruse and Burnham soon turns on Georgiou. After a fight, Georgiou kills Burnham before dying herself in Saru's arms. She returns to Dannus V, where Carl reveals himself to be the Guardian of Forever. He explains that he can send Georgiou to another time and place where she will survive, but he had to test her first and was happy to see her attempt to change the fate of the Terran Empire. Georgiou says goodbye to Burnham before traveling through the Guardian's portal. On Discovery, Book wishes to prove his worth and uses Emerald Chain technology to help the crew connect to the Kelpien starship's systems."
"Discovery detects a life sign on the starship in the radioactive Verubin Nebula, and Saru suggests this could be the child of one of the starship's scientists. They jump there to investigate, and find a planet made primarily of dilithium inside the nebula. Saru, Burnham, and Culber transport to the planet, leaving Tilly in command of Discovery. On the planet, the away team find themselves inside a complex holographic simulation designed by the scientists to raise and protect the child. They find the child, Su'Kal, and discover that he was born with biology adapted to the planet and radioactive nebula, while the away team suffers from radiation poisoning. Su'Kal is not prepared to deal with reality outside the simulation, and when he becomes upset he creates an energy surge similar to the Burn. An Emerald Chain ship commanded by Osyraa arrives. Book flies into the nebula to retrieve the away team. He gets Burnham, but the others, plus a stowaway Adira, stay with Su'Kal. Osyraa captures Discovery and makes it jump to Federation headquarters."
"Osyraa poses as an under-attack Discovery with blocked communications, and Vance decides to let the ship through the Federation's shields. Burnham and Book use the perilous transwarp network to reach Federation headquarters in time to crash land on Discovery before the shields close. Osyraa sends Zareh to investigate and he captures Book, while Burnham escapes unseen. Book is kept hostage with the bridge crew and Ryn, Stamets is interrogated by scientist Aurellio who plans to replicate Discovery's spore drive, and the rest of Discovery's crew is released in shuttles. Osyraa proposes a peace treaty between the Federation and the Emerald Chain to Vance. He considers the treaty but insists that Osyraa stand trial for her crimes, which is unacceptable to her. The bridge crew escapes with the help of Book and Ryn, who are captured again. Burnham frees Stamets and safely jettisons him from the ship to prevent his capture, despite his wish to immediately save Culber, Adira, and Saru. Aurellio is horrified when Osyraa kills prisoner Ryn."
"Unable to jump away without Stamets, Osyraa fights her way out of Federation headquarters and shuts off life support for the bridge crew. Despite this, Tilly and the bridge crew are able to plant a bomb in one of the ship's nacelles with the help of the Sphere data, dropping Discovery from warp. Burnham makes her way to the ship's data core, kills Osyraa in a fight, and resets the computer systems. She turns life support back on and beams all Emerald Chain fighters off the ship. Aurellio, after a change in heart, suggests that Book could use the spore drive with his empathic abilities, and they jump to the nebula. Saru helps Su'Kal turn the simulation off and come to terms with the death of his mother, as his reaction to that is what caused the Burn, just as Discovery arrives. Saru decides to help Su'Kal start a new life on Kaminar, and Burnham is promoted to captain. The Emerald Chain collapses after Osyraa's death, and planets begin to rejoin the Federation. Discovery sets out to bring dilithium from the nebula to planets that have been cut off by the Burn."
"Ensign D'Vana Tendi arrives on the USS Cerritos and is given a tour by ensigns Brad Boimler and Beckett Mariner. Boimler is asked by Captain Carol Freeman to report on any breaches of protocol made by Mariner. On a mission, Boimler catches Mariner giving equipment to local farmers. The pair are attacked by a farm animal which destroys Boimler's uniform and covers him in slime. Meanwhile, commander Jack Ransom unknowingly carries an alien virus from the planet surface to the Cerritos and it quickly infects much of the crew. Ensign Sam Rutherford is on a date with Ensign Barnes; they fight off infected crew members, but Rutherford loses interest because Barnes is not interested in the Cerritos's mechanics. Chief medical officer T'Ana uses the slime on Boimler to synthesize an antidote, receiving praise from Freeman. Boimler chooses not to report Mariner, to the chagrin of Freeman who is Mariner's mother and was looking for a reason to have her removed from the ship. Mariner thanks Boimler and decides to mentor him towards becoming a captain."
"Boimler is assigned to a mission to transport Klingon general K'orin to the Federation Embassy on Tulgana IV. Mariner has herself assigned to the same mission, revealing that she is old friends with K'orin. The pair drink and reminisce while Boimler flies them to the planet. After they land, a drunken K'orin steals the shuttlecraft. While tracking down K'orin, Boimler feels he is unprepared for field work compared to Mariner, and threatens to quit Starfleet. They are offered assistance from a Ferengi whom Mariner believes is trustworthy, but Boimler cautions against this and is proven correct when the Ferengi pulls a knife on them. Boimler scares the Ferengi away. The pair find K'orin and leave him at the embassy before returning to the Cerritos. Boimler teases Mariner about the Ferengi, unaware that Mariner had staged the incident. Meanwhile, Rutherford transfers from engineering to other divisions hoping to have more time to spend with Tendi. He decides that engineering is where he wants to be, and she chooses to spend time with him while he works."
"The Cerritos is en route to Cardassia Prime for peace negotiations when it is re-assigned to instead deliver ""diplomatic trinkets"" to Gelrak V. This angers Freeman, who believes the Cerritos is not respected by Starfleet. The ensigns teach Tendi about ""buffer time"", a long-standing tradition in which the lower decks crew take time to relax between jobs. Boimler accidentally reveals this to Freeman, who institutes a time deadline for all tasks. The ship descends into chaos as the crew attempts to complete their work on time, and this causes the away team to take the wrong gift to Gelrak V. In anger, the people of Gelrak V attack the Cerritos. The crew is unable to respond until Boimler reminds Freeman that they need to be able to complete work in their own time. She halts the time deadlines and the crew are able to focus on repelling the attackers. Freeman later institutes a new mandate named ""The Boimler Effect"" that encourages crew members to take shortcuts, not blindly follow the rules, and build in ""buffer time"" whenever they deem fit."
"The Cerritos joins a joint mission with the USS Merced to tow a disabled generation ship. The ship carries terraforming material that converts inert matter to organic matter. Freeman gives Mariner the most disliked jobs in an effort to force her to transfer to another ship, but Mariner finds a way to make these tasks enjoyable. Freeman then promotes Mariner to lieutenant in an effort to bore her into transferring. During the mission, the terraforming material cripples the Merced and begins terraforming the Cerritos. Mariner works with Freeman to escape the terraforming and use environmental controls to return the ship to its previous state, as well as rescue the crew of the Merced. Meanwhile, Tendi's clumsiness prevents Lieutenant O'Connor's spiritual ascension. During the terraforming disaster, O'Connor nearly sacrifices himself to save Tendi's life. This act causes him to ascend with what appears to be painful results. Afterwards, Mariner is demoted back to ensign for making fun of an admiral's uncommon pronunciation of the word ""sensor""."
"Boimler welcomes his girlfriend, Barbara, onto the Cerritos. Mariner doubts that Barbara is sincerely interested in Boimler, and becomes obsessed with proving her hypothesis. The Cerritos provides support to the USS Vancouver in the controlled demolition of an unstable moon, as Freeman deals with the alien politics involved before it can proceed. Rutherford and Tendi are excited to tour the larger Vancouver with its state-of-the-art technology. After a brief competitive exercise, Lt. Commander Docent demands to transfer one of them to the Vancouver, against their wishes, resulting in a brief scuffle. Docent later admits he can't handle the exciting and epic adventures on board the Vancouver and was hoping to swap with them to a more boring ship. Mariner discovers that Barbara is under the influence of an alien parasite attached to Boimler, which she removes. Barbara leaves Boimler, while Mariner and Barbara find they have much in common and become friends. Freeman completes the demolition of the moon."
"The Cerritos finds itself in a standoff with the Drookmani over the salvage of an old Starfleet ship. Mariner and Boimler's friend, Ensign Fletcher, offers to recalibrate the ship's isolinear cores for them, so the two can leave work early to attend a concert. They return to find him the victim of an attack, with the shield core missing. Rutherford shows off his new holographic assistant, an anthropomorphic Starfleet badge named Badgey, to Tendi in the holodeck. The Drookmani begin to attack the Cerritos, now without shields, causing a holodeck malfunction. This results in Badgey becoming homicidal and attacking Rutherford and Tendi. They defeat him by changing the holodeck program to a tundra which freezes Badgey. Boimler and Mariner discover Fletcher staged the attack because he was unable to complete the work. The missing core goes on a rampage before being blown out of an airlock. It drifts to the Drookmani ship and disables it. Fletcher is rewarded for stopping the Drookmani with a transfer to the USS Titan, where he is fired a week later."
"Boimler volunteers to test Rutherford's new transporter upgrade, which malfunctions and leaves him ""phasing"". Tendi genetically engineers a dog with an array of freakish abilities. Both are transferred for medical care to ""The Farm"" on board the USS Osler. Other patients on board believe The Farm does not exist. Freeman is assigned to a covert mission, and Mariner's old friend Captain Amina Ramsey takes temporary command in their absence. To avoid being promoted by Ramsey, Mariner displays uncharacteristic incompetence, but is forced to confidently take control when the Cerritos finds the USS Rubidoux being torn apart by a hatching space-born entity. The patients on the Osler attempt a mutiny, but are betrayed by Boimler who recovers from his phasing and attempts to make peace. As the patients are about to blow him out of an airlock, they arrive at The Farm, which is a real, luxurious medical spa planet whose inhabitants receive the best care. Boimler tries to stay, but is sent back to the Cerritos. Ramsey parts amicably with Mariner."
"Mariner, Boimler, Tendi and Rutherford are brought before an alien court by Clar, who demands they testify about the actions of the Cerritos' senior crew. Mariner relates a story about a mishandled standoff with the insectoid Clickets, who are aggravated by Mariner misunderstanding Freeman's orders. Rutherford recalls a high-stakes mission stealing a Romulan Bird of Prey from a Vulcan museum but has gaps in his memory due to his cybernetic implant. Tendi testifies about being mistakenly brought on a covert mission on the Bird of Prey to Romulus to steal a package. Clar doubts these stories, claiming that Starfleet officers should know what is happening on their ship, but Boimler assures him that Starfleet crew members make mistakes all the time (including antics with Q or boarding the wrong vessel), and accuses Clar of holding a drumhead trial. Clar clarifies that this is a actually a party celebrating his rescue from Romulus by the Cerritos, and he was just seeking an account of those events. The ensigns later ignore another encounter with Q."
"To prepare for an interview with Freeman, Boimler creates a holodeck program using the crews' private logs to produce an accurate simulation of the Cerritos. Freeman sends Mariner to therapy, where she insists she is fine. Later, Mariner spitefully takes over Boimler's program to create a movie-like experience where she plays the villainous Vindicta. She invades the simulation of the Cerritos with her friends and kills the crew. Boimler and Rutherford join the holographic crew to fight against Vindicta, while Tendi leaves the simulation after being disturbed by Mariner's behaviour. Mariner ultimately crashes the simulation of the Cerritos and then fights a holographic recreation of herself, causing her to realize her true feelings for her mother and Starfleet. Concluding this ""therapy"" has worked, she leaves the holodeck. Boimler completes the simulation and accidentally discovers that Freeman is Mariner's mother. With this knowledge, Boimler panics and fails in his interview with the captain."
"Boimler inadvertently reveals to the crew that Mariner is Freeman's daughter. The Cerritos picks up new crew members, including an Exocomp named Peanut Hamper. They receive a distress call from the USS Solvang, and find it destroyed by the Pakled, who have become a threat while being ignored by Starfleet. They begin tearing apart the Cerritos. Rutherford plans to disable the Pakled using a computer virus developed by Badgey. Peanut Hamper refuses to deliver the virus, forcing Lieutenant Shaxs and Rutherford to fly a shuttle to the Pakled ship. There, Badgey uploads the virus but also engages the ship's self-destruct to kill Rutherford. Shaxs takes Rutherford's cybernetic implants and sacrifices himself to help Rutherford escape; the latter loses his long-term memory. When more Pakled ships arrive, the Cerritos is saved by the USS Titan, captained by William Riker. A funeral is held for Shaxs. Freeman makes peace with Mariner and proposes they work together to bend Starfleet regulations. Boimler accepts a promotion to the USS Titan."
"The USS Cerritos is completing second contact with the planet Apergos when Ensign Beckett Mariner, the daughter of Captain Carol Freeman, discovers an ancient defense system while power-washing the buildings. It attacks Mariner, discharging a beam of energy that instead hits First Officer Jack Ransom and gives him god-like abilities. Ensign D'Vana Tendi becomes concerned that her friend Ensign Sam Rutherford's personality has drastically changed since he lost his memory and got a new eye cyborg implant. She attempts to fix them with her medical equipment, but scares him off. Tendi decides to implement more extreme measures, but soon realizes how she is treating her friend and makes up with Rutherford. Ransom goes mad with his new power and sends his giant, floating head into space to attack the Cerritos. On the ground, Mariner kicks his headless body in the crotch which diminishes his powers and eventually returns him to normal. On the USS Titan, Ensign Brad Boimler struggles while serving under William Riker."
"After a prominent member of the Collector's guild dies, the Cerritos is tasked with preparing his collection to be catalogued. The new chief of security, Kayshon, joins the away team with Mariner, Tendi, Rutherford, and Jet Manhaver, an ensign who takes over Boimler's position and makes Mariner feel threatened. Meanwhile, on the Titan, Boimler helps an away team survive a dangerous mission but is accidentally cloned when he is being transported back to the ship. Unknown to starfleet Collector Siggi steals a rare mask, whereupon the dead collector's automated ship goes into lockdown and attacks the away team as they try to escape. Kayshon is turned into a rag doll in the chaos. Freeman does not check in with the team following a leadership review that criticized her for micro-managing. Manhaver and Mariner clash over their different approaches to escaping, before realizing that they need to let Rutherford and Tendi take charge. They make it back to the Cerritos, where Boimler is now assigned to separate him from the clone that stays with the Titan."
"Chief medical officer T'Ana sends Tendi on a mission to retrieve an important family heirloom, and Mariner joins her. After retrieving an old box, they decide to look at what is inside and find a ""libido post"" that Caitians like T'Ana use to relieve their annual need to have sex. The pair accidentally break the post and are unable to fix it, with Tendi returning it to T'Ana broken. The doctor says that she only wanted the box anyway. Rutherford is startled to see tactical officer Shaxs walking around the Cerritos after Shaxs had sacrificed his life to save Rutherford. He is assured that members of Starfleet's bridge crews die and return in many different ways quite often, but still wants to know how Shaxs survived. When he finally builds up the courage to ask, Shaxs tells him something so horrifying that Rutherford is scarred forever. When Lieutenant Tom Paris boards the ship, Boimler wants to meet him and have Paris sign a commemorative plate with his face on it, but due to access issues he has to crawl through the Jefferies tube to get to the bridge."
"When a rare Mugato is detected on a planet that it should not be on, the Cerritos is sent to investigate. Mariner, Boimler, and Rutherford join Shaxs and the away team, but not before Boimler and Rutherford learn from the Cerritos bartender that Mariner may be a Section 31 spy. The team discovers many Mugatos that are being kept captive by Ferengi, who are harvesting and selling the animals' horns. The away team attacks and the Mugatos are released, but Boimler and Rutherford get lost in the chaos. The Ferengi's buyer attempts to escape and is captured by the Cerritos, which accidentally destroys his ship. Freeman compensates him with a shuttle and some valuable items, before learning that this was a scam. Boimler and Rutherford find Mariner and she convinces them that she is not a spy. Together they convince the Ferengi to change their operation into a Mugato sanctuary and profit off visitors. On the Cerritos, Tendi is tasked with tracking down and scanning crew members who have been avoiding their regular medical checkups."
"The USS Cerritos heads to Starbase 25, escorting a Doopler emissary. Dooplers are a species that involuntarily duplicate when embarrassed. The crew are strained to make him comfortable, but look forward to enjoying a Starfleet afterparty being held at the starbase. Boimler continues to describe his time on the USS Titan to Mariner's annoyance, but she hatches a plan for the two of them to sneak into the afterparty using Boimler's clone's invitation. Meanwhile, Tendi and Rutherford work on rebuilding a favorite model ship of theirs, but Rutherford is frustrated that he cannot rebuild it with seemingly the same ease as his earlier self. Captain Freeman accidentally embarrasses the Doopler emissary, causing him to uncontrollably duplicate throughout the ship as they arrive at the starbase. At the party, only Boimler is allowed in, causing Mariner to reiterate her feelings that Boimler abandoned her to work on the Titan. He leaves the party to join her at a dive bar on the base and they reconcile. Tendi reveals to Rutherford that the ship model was made to be incomplete by his former self so that the two could continue spending time together, and she reassures him that he is himself. Captain Freeman realizes that the Doopler can pull himself together if he is angered and orders the crew to insult him until he coheres. She and the senior officers head to the afterparty, but find themselves shut out and ignored by the other captains. Mariner invites them to the dive bar, where they all discover that Kirk and Spock once drank there, too. The crew celebrates together, with Mariner and Boimler carving their names in the bar alongside Kirk and Spock's."
"The USS Cerritos takes in a Pakled refugee, but come to suspect him of being a spy, albeit an inept one. Captain Freeman orders Commander Ransom and Lieutenant Kayshon to keep him busy, while she attempts to negotiate a ceasefire with Pakled leadership. Meanwhile, the lower deck crew have been assigned anomaly consolidation duty, cleaning up dangerous and unpredictable mission anomalies left over by the crew. Tendi attempts to keep positive despite Mariner and Rutherford's disdain, while Boimler is invited to join a group of red shirts. The group have ambitions of obtaining higher ranks, styling themselves after captains, and are interested in Boimler's Titan experience. They give Boimler a makeover and urge him to distance himself from the other lower deck members. As the work becomes taxing, Tendi merges with an artifact feeding off of her frustration, turning her into a large scorpion-like creature that runs rampant through the ship. While the red shirts do nothing but pontificate to prove their crisis leadership skills, Boimler takes action to make Tendi laugh at his own expense, freeing her from the artifact's influence. The red shirts express distaste for Boimler making a fool of himself, but Boimler tells them that their pretenses are a waste of time, and that true captains take action to help their friends and crew. During negotiations, the spy returns from the ship and Freeman is able to get him to reveal that they plan to attack Earth with a Veruvian bomb. Meanwhile, the lower deck crew use a submanifold casting stone they recovered during their cleanup to prank call Armus."
"The USS Cerritos is hailed by Queen Paolana, ruler of Hysperia, a Renaissance-styled society from a planet colonized by fantasy enthusiasts. She asks her son, Lieutenant Commander Andarithio Billups, to help fix an issue with engines of their ship, the Monaveen. Billups reluctantly agrees, wary of his mother's repeated attempts to lure him back to the kingdom from Starfleet by attempting to have him lose his virginity, which, by Hypserian tradition, would result in him ascending to the throne as king. Meanwhile, Boimler is disappointed after he is reassigned from an exciting field mission to instead join Mariner in escorting a malevolent computer AI named AGIMUS to the Daystrom Institute for study. Their ship is caught in an anomaly and crash lands, stranding them on a desert planet, unable to send a distress signal. AGIMUS offers to assist them if they will connect him to an available computer, but they refuse. Billups and Rutherford work on the Monaveen's engines, but Billups witnesses the engines explode, seemingly killing Rutherford and Paolana, and forcing him to ascend as king. Tendi is devastated by Rutherford's death, but locates his cybernetic implant signaling aboard the Monaveen and realizes that he and Paolana are alive, and the explosion was a ruse by Paolana to get Billups to return to Hysperia. Rutherford is able to stop Billups from losing his virginity to Paolana's sexually-trained Hysperian Royal Guards in time, and Billups returns to the Cerritos. Meanwhile, with the situation dire, AGIMUS attempts to sow discord between Mariner and Boimler, revealing that she had him reassigned, as she did not believe he was capable of the field mission. Boimler fights and incapacitates Mariner and connects AGIMUS to a deserted ship's computers, where AGIMUS revels in its new plans to take over the system with its returned access. However, Boimler reveals that he tricked AGIMUS, and merely used its battery to send a distress signal, knowing it can't be trusted. As they are rescued and AGIMUS is deposited at the institute, Mariner is impressed at Boimler's savvy and apologizes for getting him reassigned."
"Friction between the members of lower decks and the senior officers grows when the lower decks members are accidentally left behind in space following a spacewalk repair mission. A Pandronian drill instructor Shari yn Yem arrives from Starfleet to oversee a series of holodeck drills on the USS Cerritos to build better understanding between the crew, first by having the lower decks members switch responsibilities with the senior officers. However, the entire ship's crew fail their assigned drills, with the exception of Ensign Boimler, who achieves high marks in his Borg drill, but obsessively reruns the drill in an attempt to achieve a perfect score. Conflict comes to a head when Mariner and Captain Freeman's disagreements cause the team to fail a simple docking drill in record time. Their failure causes them to better appreciate one another, and they come to suspect that the drills were rigged for failure, believing this was Shari's plan all along to bring them together. However, Shari reveals that the rigged drills were actually a bid to ensure her continued employment with the Federation, and that she plans to send the Cerritos's failed scores to prove her necessity, which will likely result in the ship's decommission. Realizing that Boimler is the only crew member still running an active drill, they tell him to stall the drill to prevent the scores' finalizations. While Boimler runs through the drill again, Freeman has the crew fly into a series of dangerous situations, terrifying Shari, and demonstrating that the crew are more than capable and that Shari's drills aren't informed by real world experience. Freeman threatens to continue putting the ship through these runs until Shari changes their score to passing, which she does. Afterward, Freeman and the senior officers apologize to the lower decks members by providing them with a senior officer food replicator."
"The USS Cerritos goes on a 12-hour warp, allowing the crew a day of rest, but Ensign Boimler finds himself as the only one of his friends to lack a bridge member to spend time with. Encountering Commander Ransom and his group of friends, all from Hawaii, Boimler lies about being from Hawaii as well to gain their friendship. Meanwhile, aboard a Klingon Bird of Prey, the Che'ta, lower decks officer Ma'ah hopes to rise to second officer to Captain Dorg. On a Vulcan cruiser, the Sh'Vahl, lower decks officer T'lyn comes into conflict with her captain and fellow crew when her work and her emotional reasoning step outside the prescribed tasks at hand. T'lyn detects an anomaly in the sector and, despite her also urging her captain to investigate based on her instincts, her captain acquiesces to her sound logic. Ma'ah gains Dorg's respect and accompanies him to a meeting with the Pakleds. He is disturbed to learn that Dorg has been supplying the Pakleds with weapons and Veruvian bombs that they intend to use against Earth. Dorg hopes to instigate a war and come to glory over their allies and enemies. The Pakleds' testing of the Veruvian bombs has caused the local anomalies. The Cerritos detects the anomalies and drops out of warp, encountering the Pakleds and the Che'ta, which attack. During the assault, Boimler confesses to Ransom that he isn't Hawaiian, but Ransom and the others reveal they also lied and just enjoy each other's company. The Cerritos is saved by the arrival of the Sh'Vahl. Aboard the Che'ta, Ma'ah challenges Dorg's dishonorable use of the Pakleds and his insubordination of the Klingon High Council's wishes, killing him in battle and becoming captain. He orders the Che'ta to retreat to the Klingon home world. The Pakleds flee. Despite turning the tide of the battle, T'lyn is punished for her continued emotional transgressions by being transferred to a Starfleet ship. Aboard the Cerritos, Ransom recommends Boimler to assist a young ensign. Boimler gladly mentors him, emphasizing that the heart of the ship is its lower decks."
"The Cerritos is assigned to assist the USS Archimedes under Captain Sonya Gomez (""Q Who,"" ""Samaritan Snare"") in a first-contact mission. However, a solar flare results in the Archimedes losing power and being pulled into the planet's gravity well. With only 20 hours in which to work, Freeman must galvanize the crew into making modifications to the Cerritos that will allow her to close with the Archimedes and stabilize her with a tractor beam. Compounding the problem is the fact that Freeman has been offered a promotion, which will take her off the Cerritos while everyone else stays behind; Mariner, overhearing and with her fear of abandonment rearing its ugly head, spreads the word to the senior staff, who begin to bicker with Freeman. Tendi learns that she is being removed from Sickbay staff and begins to fret. Finally, Rutherford begins having trouble with his cybernetic implant, which is running out of storage space: he admits to Billups that he makes triple redundant backups of his memories of Tendi, unwilling to lose their friendship again. The day culminates when Boimler, in Cetacean Ops, flips the switch on the final modification, allowing the Cerritos saves the Archimedes. Tendi learns that she's being promoted to the Sciences division, as Dr. T'Ana feels her potential is wasted in Sickbay. Rutherford, deleting his redundant memories, receives a flashback which suggests his cybernetic implant was installed against his wishes. Lastly, Freeman is arrested for detonating a Veruvian bomb on Pakled Planet; the crew, gathered to wish her well in her promotion, must instead witness her being taken away manacled."
"In an interview, retired Starfleet Admiral Jean-Luc Picard reveals that he resigned in protest after Starfleet abandoned plans to rescue Romulan citizens from a supernova when rogue synthetics attacked the rescue fleet. Starfleet banned synthetics after the attack. Romulan assassins attack a young woman named Dahj, killing her partner. This triggers something in Dahj, and she kills the assassins. Experiencing visions of Picard and seeing his interview, Dahj seeks him out. Picard visits Starfleet Archives and finds a painting entitled ""Daughter"" by android lieutenant commander Data. The painting features a figure resembling Dahj. More assassins attack Picard and Dahj, and Dahj is killed. Picard meets with Dr. Agnes Jurati at the Daystrom Institute, who explains that Dahj could be Data's daughter due to an experimental procedure known as fractal neuronic cloning, which results in twin androids with organic bodies. Meanwhile, Dahj's twin, Soji Asha, works in a Borg Cube that has been reclaimed by Romulan refugees."
"Hoping to find Soji before the assassins get to her, Picard investigates Dahj's apartment with his Romulan employee Laris. The latter believes the assassins may be members of the Zhat Vash, a secretive organization with a deep-rooted hatred of synthetics, and helps Picard discover Soji's location from Dahj's computer. On the Borg Cube, called the ""Artifact"", Soji develops a relationship with Romulan agent Narek, while she works on a project to remove Borg technology from former Borg drones. Despite the onset of a terminal illness, Picard asks Starfleet Admiral Kirsten Clancy for a ship and crew to find Soji. She refuses and refers the incident to Starfleet's security chief Commodore Oh, who discusses the incident with a lieutenant; this is Narek's sister Narissa in disguise. Narissa led the assassins to kill Dahj, while Narek is approaching his target, Soji, with seduction rather than violence. Picard begins to assemble his own crew to find Soji, starting with his former Starfleet first officer Raffi Musiker."
"When Picard resigned following the synth attack on Mars, Starfleet fired Raffi. Now she resents him for that, and for not helping her in the subsequent years, and refuses to join him. However, she does find him a freelance pilot named Rios. On the Artifact, the reclamation project's director, the former Borg drone Hugh, allows Soji to interview a Romulan that has been reclaimed from the Borg. This Romulan declares Soji to be ""the destroyer"" and tries to kill herself, but Soji unknowingly uses her enhanced speed to stop her. Narissa warns Narek not to get emotionally attached to Soji. Oh approaches Dr. Jurati, who reveals her discussion with Picard. Shortly after this, Picard is attacked by Zhat Vash operatives. Jurati helps kill all of them but one, who also calls Soji ""the destroyer"" before committing suicide. Picard agrees to take Jurati on his mission to find Soji, and the pair transport aboard Rios's ship La Sirena. There they are also joined by Raffi who believes that Soji's creator Bruce Maddox is on Freecloud and will travel with them that far."
"Picard asks Rios to make a detour to the planet Vashti, where he helped relocate Romulan refugees before the attack on Mars. He goes to the temple of the Qowat Milat, warrior nuns who raised a boy named Elnor when Picard abandoned him after resigning from Starfleet. Picard asks Elnor, now an adult and skilled fighter, to join him on his quest; Elnor initially refuses but changes his mind when Picard is attacked by Romulans who resent Starfleet abandoning the evacuation effort. Picard and Elnor beam up to La Sirena, where Rios and Raffi are fighting with a local warlord. A mystery ship helps La Sirena win the battle but is damaged in the process. They beam the pilot, former Borg drone Seven of Nine, to La Sirena. On the Artifact, Soji tries to learn more about the Romulans that were assimilated by the Artifact and their prophesied ""destroyer"". Narek offers to get her information on the ship, but they have a falling out when he expresses doubt about her past. Narissa gives Narek one week to get information on other synths from Soji."
"Years ago, Seven of Nine was forced to euthanize her close friend Icheb after his Borg implants were ripped out by black market dealer Bjayzl. Now, Seven travels with La Sirena to Freecloud, where Raffi learns that Bjayzl has Maddox captive and intends to sell him to the Romulans. To free Maddox, Picard's crew stage a prisoner exchange with Seven as the bait. Meanwhile, Raffi unsuccessfully tries to reconnect with her estranged son Gabriel before returning to La Sirena. When Bjayzl recognizes Seven, the latter drops the charade and reveals her true intention: to kill Bjayzl and avenge Icheb. Picard convinces Seven not to seek revenge, and Maddox is safely beamed to La Sirena. Later, Seven returns to Freecloud and kills Bjayzl without Picard's knowledge. In sickbay, Maddox tells Picard that he sent Soji and Dahj to the Artifact and Earth, respectively, in order to discover the true motivation behind the synth ban. Once left alone by Picard, Jurati talks with Maddox, with whom she had secretly been in a relationship, before murdering him."
"Narek realizes that Soji has the same nightmare each night, and plans to use this to find where she was created. Struggling with the guilt of murdering Maddox, Jurati has sex with Rios. To board the Artifact without causing a diplomatic incident with the Romulans, Picard asks Raffi to procure official clearance from the Federation. Raffi, drunk and high following her son's rejection, convinces an old Starfleet friend to provide the clearance. This allows Picard to beam aboard the Artifact and reconnect with Hugh. Due to Narek's manipulation, Soji begins to discover that her identity was recently manufactured, and he guides her through the Romulan meditation practice of Zhal Makh to explore her dreams: she is able to identify clues hinting at the place she was created. Narek tells Soji that she is not real, and attempts to poison her with radiation. This activates her self-defense mechanism, and she runs into Picard and Hugh. The latter helps them transport to the nearby planet Nepenthe. Elnor beams aboard the Artifact to help Hugh cover their tracks."
"When Jurati was approached by Oh, the latter used a Vulcan mind meld to reveal the horrifying potential consequences of synthetic life like Soji. Jurati agreed to help and ingested a tracking device. Narek now uses that to track La Sirena until a guilt-ridden Jurati takes an injection that places her in a coma and stops the tracking. Elnor's attempts to protect Hugh on the Artifact are unsuccessful when Narissa fatally wounds Hugh. Before dying, Hugh gives Elnor a device to signal Seven of Nine's vigilante group, the Fenris Rangers. On Nepenthe, Picard reunites with his old friends and colleagues William Riker and Deanna Troi, whose son Thad died after the medical procedure he required was banned as part of the synthetic ban. Riker, Troi, and their daughter Kestra give shelter to Picard and Soji until La Sirena arrives. Troi and Riker can see Soji's pain following Narek's betrayal, and help Picard begin to earn her trust. The Troi-Rikers also try to help Soji come to terms with being an android, and are able to help identify the location from her dream."
"Picard and Soji beam aboard La Sirena. Rios has a panic attack when he sees Soji. When Jurati wakes up she offers to turn herself over to Starfleet, and after meeting Soji she chooses not to harm her. Rios tells Raffi about his Starfleet captain, who murdered two people on Starfleet's orders before committing suicide. Raffi also pieces together that the Romulans discovered a warning from a past civilization about the horrors of evolved synthetic life, and the Zhat Vash sent the half-Romulan Oh to infiltrate Starfleet and instigate the Mars attack as part of their anti-synth plan. The people Rios's captain murdered were synths from Soji's homeworld, and one of them, Janna, looked just like her. Hearing this activates memories for Soji and she plots a course for her home, still followed by Narek. On the Artifact, Seven of Nine arrives to help Elnor fight the Romulans. She connects with the Cube and the Borg drones that are in stasis on it, but the Romulans release these drones into space. They then abandon the Artifact and prepare to invade the synth world."
"Part 1: Using a Borg transwarp conduit, La Sirena arrives at Soji's homeworld, Coppelius, several days before the Romulan fleet. Narek arrives and attacks, but is interrupted when the Artifact follows them through the transwarp conduit as well. A planetary defense system in the form of giant orchids drags the three ships to the planet's surface, and Picard requires medical attention following the crash. Jurati discovers his terminal illness, and Picard reveals it to the rest of the crew. After finding Elnor and Seven alive in the wreckage of the Artifact, the crew travels to the settlement where Dahj and Soji were created. They find Maddox's partner (and the son of Data's creator) Altan Inigo Soong with a colony of synths, including Janna's twin Sutra. Sutra uses a mind meld to see the vision Oh showed Jurati, and believes that it is a message to synthetic life from higher beings willing to destroy organic life. Soong, Soji, and the other synths support Sutra's plan to call these beings before the Romulans arrive. Picard disagrees, and is taken prisoner. Part 2: Narek convinces Raffi, Rios, and Elnor to help him destroy the synths' beacon. Jurati frees Picard and the pair escape to La Sirena, which Picard flies to confront and stall the Romulans. Narissa targets La Sirena with the Artifacts' defenses, but is stopped and killed by Seven of Nine. Soong discovers that Sutra worked with Narek to convince the other synths to agree with her plan, and he incapacitates her. Soji foils the attempt to destroy the beacon, and activates it. Picard begins to succumb to his illness, but Jurati prolongs his life long enough for him to distract the Romulans until a Starfleet armada arrives in support, led by Riker. This gives Soji the choice to turn the beacon off herself, which she does. The Romulans retreat. Picard dies after Jurati and Soong transfer his consciousness into a device holding Maddox's copy of Data. Picard says goodbye to Data before awaking in a synthetic ""golem"" body. After the Federation lifts the ban on synths, Picard and Soji set off in La Sirena with Rios, Raffi, Jurati, Elnor, and Seven of Nine."
